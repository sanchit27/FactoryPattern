# Factory Pattern Pizza Example in Java
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Factory Pattern for creating different types of pizzas.

Overview
The code defines an interface called Pizza that specifies methods for preparing, baking, cutting, and boxing a pizza. It also includes three different pizza classes (CheesePizza, PepperoniPizza, and VeggiePizza) that implement the Pizza interface.

The PizzaFactory class is used to create instances of different pizza types based on a given type (cheese, pepperoni, or veggie). The main method in the Main class creates instances of each pizza type using the PizzaFactory, and calls methods on them to prepare, bake, cut, and box each pizza.
